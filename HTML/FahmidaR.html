            </h3>
            <div class="blockquote">
               <p>Born in <span class="placeName">Meerut</span>, India, Fahmida Riaz is among the
                  front rank of Urdu poets. From the outset she refused to be typecast as a woman
                  poet and conform to what are generally regarded as the confines of 'proper'
                  literary and creative traditions of feminine poetry. In her choice of themes,
                  diction, allusion, and similes she broke out of the inhibitions imposed on her
                  gender. This was evident from the contents of her first collection of verse, <span
                     class="italic">Patthar Ki Zaban</span> (published in 1967). With the
                  publication of her second collection, <span class="italic">Badan Dareeda</span>,
                  she emerged as a full-fledged iconoclast. The poem, <span class="italic">Badan
                     Dareeda</span>, which carried the same title as the collection, can be regarded
                  as something of a landmark, putting her in the same category as lsmat Chughtai who
                  wrote the short story <span class="italic">Lihaf</span>. Fahmida Riaz used her
                  femininity as a weapon to expose the prudishness of the male-oriented traditions
                  of Urdu poetry. She has since published four more collections of her verse <span
                     class="italic">Dhoop</span>, <span class="italic">Kya Tum Pura Chand Na
                     Dekhogay</span>, <span class="italic">Hamrakab and Aadmi Ki Zindigi</span>.
                  Fahmida Riaz is also the author of several short stories and novels in Urdu: <span
                     class="italic">Godavari</span>, based on her Indian experience, and <span
                     class="italic">Zinda Bahar Lane</span> based on Bangladesh.</p>
               <p>Fahmida Riaz is also an unrelenting social critic and has been active in several
                  human rights movements. She was among the writer who campaigned against General
                  Ziaul Haq's military rule and the execution of Z.A. Bhutto, and had to suffer the
                  wrath of the authorities and a period of self-exile. She has travelled widely and
                  lectured at universities and cultural forums in England and the USA. Fahmida Riaz
                  was given the Himmett-Hellman award by Human Rights Watch, <span class="placeName"

            <p>In her foreword to <span class="italics">Patthar ki Zaban</span>, her first
               collection of poems, Fahmida Riaz told her readers that she never had written, and
               never would write, until a poem compelled her to give it a form; she had not
               attempted to write ghazals, as she would not make any compromises for the sake of
               rhythm or rhyme; and she foresaw herself writing for only three or four years more,
               as after that she would not have anything left to say. The year was <span
                  class="date">1966</span>, and Fahmida - who was barely twenty when she wrote these
               words - was writing from Government Girls Hostel, in <span class="placeName"
                  >Hyderabad</span>, <span class="placeName">Sindh</span> where she had, until then,
               spent her life.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In her foreword to <span class="italics">Patthar ki Zaban</span>, her first
               collection of poems, Fahmida Riaz told her readers that she never had written, and
               never would write, until a poem compelled her to give it a form; she had not
               attempted to write ghazals, as she would not make any compromises for the sake of
               rhythm or rhyme; and she foresaw herself writing for only three or four years more,
               as after that she would not have anything left to say. The year was <span
                  class="date">1966</span>, and Fahmida - who was barely twenty when she wrote these
               words - was writing from Government Girls Hostel, in <span class="placeName"
                  >Hyderabad</span>, <span class="placeName">Sindh</span> where she had, until then,
               spent her life two full-length works in English: a controversial critical study of
               Pakistani literature, and an as yet unpublished novel).</p>
            <br>
            <p>But we first return to the years in between and to Fahmida's first collection of
               poems. The beauty of these early poems - including the title poem and <span
                  class="italics">'The Soft Fragrance of My Jasmine'</span> - is unquestionable. Not
               only are their subject matter and their refusal to conform to the conventions of Urdu
               verse exceptional, their imagery is graceful, their syntax pure, their effect
               haunting and musical. But perhaps the reader is still unprepared for the power of
                  <span class="italics">'Badan Darida'</span>, the volume that followed. We do have,
               in fiction, the example of Ismat Chughtai who in <span class="italics">Terhi
                  Lakeer</span><span class="date">(1944)</span> foregrounded a woman's experience
               with often shocking frankness; but to accomplish it in verse, to tum raw experience
               into exquisite poems without compromising either experience or poetry, is a measure
               of Fahmida' s groundbreaking achievement not just in Urdu poetry but in the poetry of
               the world.</p>
            <br>
            <p>By then she had married and moved for some years to <span class="placeName"
                  >London</span>, where one imagines she must have encountered the literature and
               art of other languages and cultures, and probably been exposed to the emerging
               currents of feminist thought. In <span class="placeName">London</span> she had also
               become a mother. She then returned in the <span class="date">1970s</span> to a very
               different life in <span class="placeName">Pakistan</span> and settled in <span
                  class="placeName">Karachi</span>, where before she remarried she was a divorced
               working mother. Desire, motherhood, married love, menstruation, taboos, social
               constraints, cultural restrictions - all find their way into Fahmida's poems of those
               years, in unexpected and stirring patterns of intertwined boldness and subtlety.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Poems such as <span class="italics">'The Laughter of a Woman'</span> and <span
                  class="italics">'She is a Woman</span> Impure' celebrate femininity in ways that
               French feminist theorists such as Julia Kristeva, Helene Cixous and Luce Irigaray
               were to do. Just as Chughtai prefigured by several years Simone de Beauvoir's
               theoretical configurations in The Second Sex, so, too, Fahmida wrote fearlessly about
               blood, milk and the waters of birth before her western contemporaries began to
               formulate their theories of women's writing as grounded in bodily experience, and
               most certaini: oefore she could have been exposed to their writings.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What comes across most vividly, though, is the visionary grace and the indomitable
               spirit of a poet who is not only arguably Pakistan's leading woman writer, but also
               one of the half-dozen most distinguished Urdu writers of the past three decades. To
               attempt to do full justice to her multiple talents in the few pages of this foreword
               is as impossible a task as it would be to do her work full justice in translation: we
               can only content ourselves with projected shadows of the real thing. There is a
               remarkable continuity, though, between Fahmida's early foreword and the verses of one
               of her more recent poems:</p>
            <br>
            <span class="l">She always said what she had to say,</span>
            <br>
            <span class="l">And for her life she had no regrets.</span>

            sister of Abel and Cain who both wanted to marry her. God decided to resolve the dispute
            by asking them to bring their offerings. He accepted Abel's offering, a fat lamb and
            gave Aqleema's hand to him. Aqleema's preference never figured in His decision. <a
